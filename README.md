It is a data and command(task) delivery and status monitoring service for **X**.  
This process sends all content to nodes within an instance, and users can check all processes.  
The structure was simply constructed based on the Kubernetes structure, and was developed using the golang and echo framework.  
The storage was configured using memory without using a database. (Composed of key-value map data structure)

1. The flow of `commands from outside to instances` and `information from instances to outside`.  
2. The flow in which `File i/o operations are delivered by accessing the storage` inside the instance.  
3. `Deliver commands(tasks), data, and status` to nodes inside the instance. It also `binds the storage` of the instance.
